# Level 2 Enhancement Reflection: Frontend Integration & Profile Display Fix

## Enhancement Summary
Updated the React frontend to fully integrate with the new microservice API Gateway, including robust login/registration, CORS fixes, and a critical update to the Dashboard to correctly display and refresh user profile information (first name, last name, email).

## What Went Well
- Seamless integration of React frontend with microservice APIs.
- CORS issues resolved for both local and production environments.
- Profile editing and display now fully consistent with backend data.
- User experience improved with clear validation and error handling.

## Challenges Encountered
- CORS misconfiguration blocked frontend-backend communication.
- Login required backend and frontend to align on identifier/email/username logic.
- Profile display was inconsistent due to mismatched field names (`name` vs `first_name`/`last_name`).

## Solutions Applied
- Updated CORS config in all services to allow both localhost and production client URLs.
- Refactored login to accept either username or email as identifier.
- Updated Dashboard to display concatenated `first_name` and `last_name`.

## Key Technical Insights
- Always align frontend and backend field names for user data.
- Docker container rebuilds are required for backend code changes to take effect.
- CORS should be flexible for both dev and prod environments.

## Process Insights
- Iterative testing and feedback cycles are essential for frontend-backend integration.
- Memory Bank documentation streamlines debugging and knowledge transfer.

## Action Items for Future Work
- Add user avatar/profile picture support.
- Implement profile field validation on the backend.
- Add loading indicators for all async actions.

## Time Estimation Accuracy
- Estimated time: 1-2 hours
- Actual time: 2.5 hours
- Variance: +25%
- Reason for variance: Additional debugging for CORS and profile display issues.
