# TASK REFLECTION: Server Microservice Architecture Refactor

**Task ID:** TASK-004  
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Complexity Level:** Level 4 (Complex System)  
**Duration:** 6.5 hours total (VAN: 0.5h, PLAN: 2h, CREATIVE: 1.5h, BUILD: 2.5h)  
**Status:** SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

---

## 1. SYSTEM OVERVIEW

### System Description
Successfully refactored a monolithic Express.js server with SQLite database into a fully operational microservice architecture. The new system consists of 5 containerized services: API Gateway, User Service, Auth Service, PostgreSQL database, and Redis message queue. All core user flows (registration, login, password management, profile access) are working end-to-end through the API Gateway.

### System Context
This refactor transforms a simple monolithic application into a scalable, distributed system architecture. The microservice approach enables independent service development, deployment, and scaling while maintaining loose coupling through the API Gateway pattern and event-driven communication via Redis.

### Key Components
- **API Gateway (Port 3000):** Custom request forwarding with axios, service discovery, health monitoring
- **User Service (Port 3001):** User registration, profile management, password hashing with bcrypt
- **Auth Service (Port 3002):** Login, JWT generation, password change, session management
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Persistent data storage with connection pooling
- **Redis Message Queue:** Event publishing and pub/sub communication

### System Architecture
- **Pattern:** API Gateway + Microservices + Event-Driven Architecture
- **Communication:** HTTP/REST for synchronous requests, Redis pub/sub for events
- **Data Storage:** PostgreSQL for persistent data, Redis for caching and events
- **Security:** JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, input validation
- **Containerization:** Docker with Docker Compose orchestration

### System Boundaries
- **External Interface:** API Gateway exposes REST endpoints
- **Internal Communication:** Inter-service HTTP calls and Redis events
- **Data Persistence:** PostgreSQL for user data and sessions
- **Event System:** Redis pub/sub for service-to-service communication

### Implementation Summary
- **Technology Stack:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker
- **Development Approach:** Phased implementation with comprehensive testing
- **Quality Assurance:** End-to-end integration testing for all user flows
- **Documentation:** Memory Bank system for tracking and reflection
