    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES users(id),
    theme VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'light',
    language VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'en',
    notifications_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### Authentication Service Database (PostgreSQL + Redis)
```sql
-- Authentication credentials
CREATE TABLE user_credentials (
    user_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    salt VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,

3. **Credential Validation:** Auth Service validates credentials
4. **Token Generation:** JWT token created with user claims
5. **Token Return:** Gateway returns token to client
6. **Subsequent Requests:** Gateway validates JWT for protected routes

#### JWT Token Structure
```json
{
  "header": {
    "alg": "HS256",
    "typ": "JWT"
  },
  "payload": {
    "userId": 123,
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "iat": 1640995200,
    "exp": 1641081600,
    "iss": "auth-service"
  }
}
```

#### Inter-Service Security
- **API Keys:** Services authenticate with API keys for internal communication
- **Network Isolation:** Docker network isolation between services
- **HTTPS:** All external communication over HTTPS
- **Rate Limiting:** API Gateway implements rate limiting per user/IP

#### Security Headers and CORS
```javascript
// API Gateway security middleware
app.use(helmet()); // Security headers
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.FRONTEND_URL,
  credentials: true
}));
```

    email: 'string',
    name: 'string',
    timestamp: 'string'
  },
  'user.profile.updated': {
    userId: 'number',
    changes: 'object',

    this.handlers = eventHandlers;
  }

  async subscribeToEvents(eventTypes) {
    for (const eventType of eventTypes) {
      this.redis.subscribe(eventType, (message) => {
        this.handleEvent(JSON.parse(message));
      });
    }
  }

  async handleEvent(event) {
    const handler = this.handlers[event.type];
    if (handler) {
      try {
        await handler(event.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error(`Error handling event ${event.type}:`, error);
        // Implement dead letter queue or retry logic
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Event Store Implementation
```sql
-- Event store table
CREATE TABLE events (
    id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    type VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    data JSONB NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    version VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Event consumer tracking
CREATE TABLE event_consumers (
    consumer_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    last_processed_event_id VARCHAR(255),
    last_processed_at TIMESTAMP,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
