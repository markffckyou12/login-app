# Enhancement Archive: Frontend Integration & Profile Display Fix

## Summary
Frontend integration and profile display fix for microservice architecture. The React frontend now works seamlessly with the API Gateway, supports robust login/registration, and accurately displays and updates user profile information.

## Date Completed
2025-06-26

## Key Files Modified
- client/src/components/Login.jsx
- client/src/components/Register.jsx
- client/src/components/Dashboard.jsx
- client/src/components/EditProfile.jsx

## Requirements Addressed
- Frontend must work with new API Gateway
- Profile editing and display must be accurate
- CORS must allow both dev and prod clients

## Implementation Details
- Updated CORS config in all services for dev/prod flexibility
- Refactored login to accept username or email as identifier
- Updated Dashboard to display first_name and last_name
- Improved error handling and validation in all forms

## Testing Performed
- Registration, login, profile edit, and refresh tested in browser
- Verified CORS headers and cross-origin requests
- Confirmed user info updates immediately and after refresh

## Lessons Learned
- Always align frontend and backend field names
- Rebuild Docker containers after backend code changes
- CORS config must support all client environments
