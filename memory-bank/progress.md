# PROGRESS - MEMORY BANK TRACKING

## COMPLETED TASKS

### TASK-004: Server Microservice Architecture Refactor ✅ COMPLETED
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Duration:** 6.5 hours  
**Complexity:** Level 4 (Complex System)  
**Status:** SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED

#### Achievement Summary
Successfully refactored monolithic Express.js + SQLite server into fully operational microservice architecture with 5 containerized services (API Gateway, User Service, Auth Service, PostgreSQL, Redis).

#### Key Accomplishments
- ✅ Complete architectural transformation from monolithic to microservice
- ✅ End-to-end integration success with all user flows working
- ✅ Security implementation with bcrypt password hashing and JWT authentication
- ✅ Custom API Gateway solution replacing problematic middleware
- ✅ Container orchestration with Docker Compose and health checks
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation using Memory Bank system

#### Technical Deliverables
- **API Gateway:** Custom request forwarding with axios, service discovery
- **User Service:** Registration, profile management, password hashing
- **Auth Service:** Login, JWT generation, password change, session management
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with connection pooling and proper schema
- **Message Queue:** Redis pub/sub for event-driven communication
- **Infrastructure:** Docker Compose orchestration with health checks

#### Documentation
- **Reflection Document:** `memory-bank/reflection/reflection-TASK-004.md`
- **Archive Document:** `memory-bank/archive/archive-TASK-004.md`
- **Creative Phase:** `memory-bank/creative/creative-microservice-architecture.md`

#### Lessons Learned
- Test middleware interactions early and thoroughly
- Security must be designed into architecture from the start
- Custom solutions can be more reliable than off-the-shelf options
- Integration testing is critical for distributed systems
- Documentation investment pays dividends throughout development

#### Next Steps
- Production deployment preparation
- Frontend integration with new microservice APIs
- Monitoring and observability implementation
- Security audit and penetration testing
