# PROGRESS - IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

## CURRENT MILESTONE: VAN MODE INITIALIZATION

### COMPLETED STEPS
- [x] **Memory Bank Creation**
  - Created memory-bank/ directory
  - Initialized core tracking files
  - Established file structure

### IN PROGRESS
- [ ] **Platform Detection**
  - Linux environment confirmed
  - Path separator verified (forward slash)
  - Command adaptation completed

- [ ] **Essential File Creation**
  - tasks.md ‚úÖ Created
  - projectbrief.md ‚úÖ Created
  - activeContext.md ‚úÖ Created
  - progress.md üîÑ Creating
  - productContext.md ‚è≥ Pending
  - systemPatterns.md ‚è≥ Pending
  - techContext.md ‚è≥ Pending

### PENDING STEPS
- [ ] **Complexity Determination**
  - Analyze task requirements
  - Determine complexity level
  - Set implementation approach

- [ ] **System Initialization**
  - Complete Memory Bank setup
  - Prepare for next phase
  - Validate readiness

### IMPLEMENTATION PHASES

#### PHASE 1: SETUP (Current)
- [x] Memory Bank initialization
- [ ] Platform verification
- [ ] Complexity analysis
- [ ] Technology selection

#### PHASE 2: IMPLEMENTATION (Pending)
- [ ] Project structure creation
- [ ] Frontend development
- [ ] Backend logic
- [ ] Integration

#### PHASE 3: TESTING (Pending)
- [ ] Functionality testing
- [ ] User experience validation
- [ ] Bug fixes and refinements

### METRICS
- **Files Created:** 4/7 essential files
- **Platform Verified:** Linux ‚úÖ
- **Complexity Level:** TBD
- **Ready for Implementation:** No (pending completion)

### NOTES
- Following VAN mode process map
- Memory Bank structure established
- Platform-specific commands being used
- Task complexity appears manageable for direct implementation
