2. **Service Architecture Design - CREATIVE PHASE** (2-3 hours)
3. **Infrastructure Implementation** (2-3 hours)
4. **Service Implementation** (3-4 hours)
5. **Data Migration** (1-2 hours)
6. **Integration & Testing** (2-3 hours)
7. **Deployment & Documentation** (1-2 hours)

### ðŸŽ¨ CREATIVE PHASE REQUIREMENTS IDENTIFIED

The following components require creative design decisions:

#### 1. API Gateway Architecture Design
- Request routing strategy and load balancing
- Authentication middleware design and token validation
- Rate limiting policies and security headers
- Error handling patterns and logging strategies

#### 2. Service Decomposition Design
- Service boundaries and responsibility allocation
- Inter-service communication contracts and APIs
- Data ownership patterns and access controls
- Event-driven communication schemas

#### 3. Data Architecture Design
- Database schema design for each service
- Data migration strategy from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Event-driven consistency and compensation patterns
- Transaction boundaries and ACID properties

#### 4. Security Architecture Design
- JWT token flow across microservices
- Service-to-service authentication mechanisms
- API key management and rotation strategies
- Security headers, CORS, and threat mitigation

#### 5. Event-Driven Architecture Design
- Message queue patterns and event schemas
- Eventual consistency and compensation logic
- Dead letter queues and error handling
- Event ordering and idempotency patterns

## NEXT STEPS

ðŸš« **CRITICAL GATE: CREATIVE PHASE REQUIRED**  
This Level 4 task has identified multiple components requiring creative design decisions.  
**You MUST proceed to CREATIVE mode** for comprehensive design exploration.

### Ready for CREATIVE Mode Transition
- [x] All architectural requirements analyzed
- [x] Technology stack decisions documented
- [x] Implementation phases planned
- [x] Creative phase components identified
- [x] Service boundaries and responsibilities defined

## CURRENT SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
- **Monolithic Server:** `server/index.js` (488 lines)
- **Database:** SQLite (`server/users.db`)
- **Features:** User registration, login, profile management, password change
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with bcrypt hashing
- **Dependencies:** express, cors, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, express-validator, sqlite3

## TARGET MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE
- **API Gateway:** Route requests, handle authentication, cross-cutting concerns
- **User Service:** User management operations with PostgreSQL database
- **Authentication Service:** JWT token management with Redis session store
- **Infrastructure:** Docker containers, PostgreSQL, Redis, monitoring

## TECHNICAL CONTEXT
- **Working Directory:** /home/mark/Desktop/new2
- **Platform:** Linux with forward slash path separators
- **Existing Frontend:** React application in client/ directory
- **Current Backend:** Express.js monolithic server
