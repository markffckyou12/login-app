# ACTIVE CONTEXT - CURRENT FOCUS

## CURRENT PHASE: VAN MODE INITIALIZATION

### IMMEDIATE FOCUS
- **Platform Detection:** Linux environment confirmed
- **Memory Bank Setup:** Core structure created
- **Next Step:** Complete essential file creation and complexity analysis

### CURRENT STATUS
- âœ… Memory Bank directory created
- âœ… tasks.md initialized
- âœ… projectbrief.md created
- âœ… activeContext.md created
- ðŸ”„ Essential files creation in progress

### PLATFORM INFORMATION
- **OS:** Linux 5.15.0-142-generic
- **Shell:** /usr/bin/bash
- **Working Directory:** /home/mark/Desktop/new2
- **Path Separator:** Forward slash (/)

### TASK ANALYSIS IN PROGRESS
**Task:** Build simple registration/login page locally
- **Scope:** Local web application
- **Complexity:** Appears to be Level 1-2 (Quick implementation)
- **Technology Stack:** TBD (pending analysis)

### NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS
1. Create remaining essential Memory Bank files
2. Complete platform detection verification
3. Perform complexity determination
4. Initialize system for next phase

### BLOCKERS
- None currently identified

### NOTES
- Linux environment detected, using appropriate commands
- Memory Bank structure following isolation rules
- Task appears suitable for direct implementation (Level 1-2)
