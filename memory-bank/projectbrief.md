# PROJECT BRIEF - MICROSERVICE ARCHITECTURE REFACTOR

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Project Name:** Server Microservice Architecture Refactor  
**Project Type:** Complex System Transformation  
**Primary Goal:** Transform monolithic Express.js server into scalable microservice architecture

## CURRENT SYSTEM ANALYSIS
**Existing Architecture:** Monolithic Express.js Application
- **Single File:** `server/index.js` (488 lines)
- **Database:** SQLite with users table
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with bcrypt hashing
- **API Endpoints:** 6 main endpoints (register, login, profile, change-password, health)
- **Features:** User management, authentication, profile management
- **Dependencies:** express, cors, bcryptjs, jsonwebtoken, express-validator, sqlite3

## MICROSERVICE TRANSFORMATION REQUIREMENTS

### 1. SERVICE DECOMPOSITION
- **User Service:** Handle user registration, profile management
- **Authentication Service:** Handle login, JWT token management
- **API Gateway:** Route requests, handle cross-cutting concerns
- **Database Service:** Data persistence and management

### 2. INFRASTRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
- **Message Queue:** Inter-service communication (Redis/RabbitMQ)
- **Service Discovery:** Service registration and discovery
- **Load Balancer:** Distribute requests across service instances
- **Configuration Management:** Centralized configuration
- **Monitoring & Logging:** Distributed tracing and logging

### 3. DATA ARCHITECTURE
- **Database per Service:** Each service owns its data
- **Data Consistency:** Event-driven architecture for consistency
- **API Contracts:** Well-defined interfaces between services
- **Data Migration:** Strategy for existing SQLite data

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

### Functional Requirements
1. **Maintain Existing Functionality:** All current API endpoints must work
2. **Service Independence:** Services can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
3. **Data Integrity:** Ensure data consistency across services
4. **API Compatibility:** Maintain backward compatibility with frontend
5. **Authentication Flow:** Secure authentication across services

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Scalability:** Individual services can scale based on demand
2. **Resilience:** System continues to function if individual services fail
3. **Performance:** Response times should not degrade significantly
4. **Maintainability:** Clear separation of concerns and responsibilities
5. **Observability:** Comprehensive monitoring and logging

## TECHNICAL CONSTRAINTS
- **Platform:** Linux (Ubuntu/Debian-based)
- **Environment:** Local development with containerization
- **Existing Frontend:** React application must continue to work
- **Database Migration:** Gradual migration from SQLite
- **Deployment:** Docker containers with orchestration

## ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES
1. **Single Responsibility:** Each service has one clear responsibility
2. **Autonomous Services:** Services are independently deployable
3. **Decentralized Governance:** Services own their technology choices
4. **Failure Isolation:** Failure in one service doesn't cascade
5. **Evolutionary Design:** Architecture can evolve over time

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] Monolithic server successfully decomposed into microservices
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved and working
- [ ] Services can be independently deployed and scaled
- [ ] Inter-service communication established
- [ ] Data consistency maintained across services
- [ ] Monitoring and observability implemented
- [ ] Performance meets or exceeds current system
- [ ] Documentation and deployment procedures created

## PROJECT SCOPE

**IN SCOPE:**
- Service decomposition and implementation
- API Gateway implementation
- Inter-service communication
- Data migration strategy
- Service discovery and configuration
- Monitoring and logging setup
- Containerization and deployment

**OUT OF SCOPE:**
- Frontend modifications (unless required for API changes)
- Advanced orchestration (Kubernetes) - Docker Compose sufficient
- Production-grade security hardening
- Advanced monitoring tools (basic monitoring sufficient)
- Performance optimization beyond basic requirements

## RISK ASSESSMENT
- **High Risk:** Data consistency during migration
- **Medium Risk:** Service communication complexity
- **Medium Risk:** Deployment and orchestration complexity
- **Low Risk:** Breaking existing frontend functionality

## TIMELINE
- **Phase 1:** Architectural design and planning (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2:** Service implementation (4-6 hours)
- **Phase 3:** Integration and testing (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 4:** Documentation and deployment (1-2 hours)

## NOTES
- Focus on simplicity while achieving microservice benefits
- Prioritize working solution over perfect architecture
- Use modern containerization for deployment
- Maintain development workflow efficiency
